                    organized approach to studying a specific topic or problem. The process begins with defining clear
                    objectives, formulating research questions, and designing a detailed plan or methodology. This often
                    includes selecting appropriate tools and techniques for data collection and analysis. A critical
                    component of research is conducting a thorough literature review to understand existing studies,
                    identify gaps, and establish the relevance of the proposed work. Researchers are responsible for
                    collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data in a rigorous and unbiased manner.
